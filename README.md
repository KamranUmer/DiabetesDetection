# DiabetesDetection
This is Diabetes Detection project Using PreBuilt dataset.


Importing Diabetes Dataset:

I imported *Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset* from *Kaggle* because it contains alot of instances/examples(70692) for Training the model which will prrevent us from *Overfitting*.



Training Classification Model :


*SVM* can be used for diabetes prediction. However, SVM is generally considered to be a better choice for this task. This is because diabetes is a complex disease that is not easily modeled. *Scalable:* SVMs can be used to solve problems with large datasets. This flexibility allows SVM to better model the complex relationships between the features and the target variable in diabetes prediction.

This Model also contains the following:

-> Standerdization.
-> Confusion Matrx.
-> Classification Report.
-> ROC Curve.
-> Test Data.
